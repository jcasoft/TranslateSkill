Very good, I'll explain; you can say: translate to english hello my dear friends, you can also say: translate hi my dear friends to english, another way of using is asking me: do you speak other languages?. I can speak in English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Polish, Norwegian, Danish, Romanian, Slovak.
